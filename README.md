## Configuration

The menu is driven by configuration tables (assumed to be in a separate `Config.lua`). Modify these to add or remove options:

- `Config.Firearms`: List of firearms with hashes, ammo, and titles.  
- `Config.Towns`: Teleport coordinates for towns.  
- `Config.Horses`: Horse models for spawning.  
- *(See the full list in the code or Config.lua)*  

Example:  
```lua
Config.Towns = {
    { title = "Valentine", coords = { x = -179.22, y = 627.72, z = 113.09 } },
    { title = "Saint Denis", coords = { x = 2515.43, y = -1308.93, z = 48.95 } }
}
```
